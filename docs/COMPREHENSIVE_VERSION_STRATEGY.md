## Usage Examples

### For Research and Analysis
```bash
# Use focused analysis versions
npm run benchmark -- --versions=analysis_versions
```

### For Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Use all versions for thorough testing
npm run benchmark -- --versions=comprehensive
```

### For Enterprise Testing
```bash
# Use only LTS versions
npm run benchmark -- --versions=lts_only
```

### For Recent Development
```bash
# Use recent versions only
npm run benchmark -- --versions=recent_only
```

## Performance Testing Focus Areas

### 4. **Issue Investigation**
- **Known Issues**: Use key milestone versions for correlation
- **Regression Testing**: Use comprehensive coverage for detection
- **Feature Testing**: Use early releases for introduction timing
- **Compatibility**: Use all versions for ecosystem validation

## Future Considerations

### Version Updates
- **New LTS Releases**: Add to appropriate sets
- **Major Version Releases**: Include in comprehensive coverage
- **Security Updates**: Prioritize in testing schedules
- **Performance Releases**: Focus on key milestone analysis

### Testing Strategy Evolution
- **Automated Testing**: Expand to cover all version sets
