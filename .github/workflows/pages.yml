name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow deploys the benchmark results site to GitHub Pages.
# Note: When triggered by workflow_run, only artifacts from the main workflow run
# are accessible. Individual benchmark artifacts from matrix jobs are not available,
# so we rely on the 'version-comparison' artifact which consolidates all the data.
